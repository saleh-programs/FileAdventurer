## Description
"File Adventurer" is my take on a cleaner, more intuitive version of Windows' "File Explorer". I built it to reduce clutter and add features I felt were missing in the built in file system, based on my frequent use of it.

I used custom assets and animations to give it its own distinctive personality!

Features include:
- Folder Navigation / Open Files
- Create, Delete, drag & drop
- Pin, Hide, or Rename Entries
- Sort by Name, Creation Date, or Modified Date
- Track Recent Folders
- Search Entries
- Tree Mode: View all entries in a traditional nested environment
- Stack Mode: View the hierarchical structure of a specific path
